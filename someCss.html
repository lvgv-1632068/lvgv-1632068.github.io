		<p>Freemiums work because there is a low marginal cost for each new user. 
		This means that for Spotify having 100 users or having 101 cost basically
		the same because they do not create anything special for that new user it
		just adds to the load of the servers and customer service. 
		So freemiums would not work for companies that need to create new infrastructure
		for each new customer or when each new user puts a significant strain on your servers.</p>

	<h3>The free portion of Spotify: Web Player is that on your computer you can choose whatever
	music you want, in the order that you want (this means choosing shuffle or not), and lastly 
	you have unlimited skips. The draw back is that there are ads. The free portion of the Spotify:
	mobile app is that you can listen to music on the go. The draw back is that you cannot choose what
	you listen to because Spotify can add suggested songs into your queue, it must be on shuffle mode,
	you have limited skips, and there are still ads. The benefit of having the freemium version
	(Web Player and mobile app) is that they can show users the great variety and quantity of music
	available on Spotify. However, it does need to build up a premium base and it does that by having
	alluring premium features that include unlimited skips, the ability to turn off shuffle mode, no suggestions
	into queue, no ads, and the ability to download songs.</h3>
